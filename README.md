# Advent of Code 2022

https://adventofcode.com/2022

Days will have implementations in Rust, Python, or both depending how much time
I had that day. The goal is to play around and see just how painful (or not) it
is to prototype in Rust vs Python on smaller apps like this.

## Add a new challenge folder
```
export COOKIE=session=53616c7...
just template-day 5
```
This command will automatically create a `README.md` with the prompt(s). 
The challenge input will be saved to `input.txt`.

This command communicates with the Advent of Code servers to fetch this data.
**The given day must be live** before the folder will be able to be templated.
The download also requires your session cookie to fetch your personalized data.

This cookie is fairly long lived and can be extracted from the `Cookie` header
for any request to adventofcode.com. The set the `COOKIE` environment variable
with this session value
